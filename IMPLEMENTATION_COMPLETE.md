python test_production_readiness.py

# 3. Try demo
python demo_production_features.py

# 4. Configure security
python -c "from security_manager import SecurityManager; s = SecurityManager(); s.store_encrypted_keys({...})"

# 5. Run on testnet
python main.py --testnet --capital 1000
```

### Phase 2: Initial Production (Week 1)
```bash
# Start with minimal capital
python main.py --live --capital 100
```

**Monitoring:**
- Check every 2-4 hours
- Review all alerts
- Verify each trade
- Keep kill switch ready

### Phase 3: Gradual Scaling (Weeks 2-4)
```
Week 1: $100 (if break-even or profitable)
Week 2: $200 (if profitable)
Week 3: $400 (if profitable)
Week 4+: Continue 2x/week if performance holds
```
