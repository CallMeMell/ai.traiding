## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

Before proceeding, understand these critical points:

1. **Trading involves significant financial risk** - You can lose all invested capital
2. **Start small** - Begin with minimum viable capital ($50-$100)
3. **Test thoroughly** - Complete all pre-deployment tests
4. **Monitor constantly** - Especially during the first 24-48 hours
5. **Have a kill switch ready** - Be prepared to stop trading immediately
6. **Never trade with money you can't afford to lose**

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Final Configuration Review

1. **Review all configuration files:**
   ```bash
   cat config.py
   cat keys.env
   ```

2. **Verify conservative settings:**
   - Small position sizes
   - Tight risk limits
   - Stop losses enabled
   - Only tested strategies active

3. **Double-check API keys:**
   - Testnet keys removed
   - Production keys correct
   - Permissions verified

### Step 2: Pre-Flight Checks

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_system.py
python test_broker_api.py

# Verify API connection
python -c "from binance_integration import BinanceDataProvider; dp = BinanceDataProvider(); print(dp.test_connection())"

# Check security configuration
python security_manager.py
```

### Step 3: Initial Deployment (Testnet)

```bash
# Start with testnet for final validation
python main.py --testnet --capital 1000
```

**Monitor for 24 hours:**
- No errors in logs
- Orders executing correctly
- Risk management working
- Alerts functioning

### Step 4: Production Launch (Minimal Capital)

```bash
# Start with VERY small capital
python main.py --live --capital 100
```

**First 24 Hours:**
- [ ] Monitor constantly
- [ ] Check every 2-4 hours
- [ ] Verify each trade
- [ ] Review logs regularly
- [ ] Keep kill switch ready

**Days 2-7:**
- [ ] Check 3x daily
- [ ] Review daily P&L
- [ ] Analyze trade quality
- [ ] Monitor system stability

### Step 5: Gradual Scaling

Only proceed if:
- ✅ No system errors
- ✅ Profitable or break-even
- ✅ Strategy executing as expected
- ✅ Risk management working

**Scaling Schedule:**
- Week 1: $100
- Week 2: $200 (if profitable)
- Week 3: $400 (if profitable)
- Week 4+: Scale based on performance

**Maximum increase: 2x per week**

# Or if using systemd
sudo systemctl stop trading-bot

# Manually close all positions via exchange interface
```

### When to Use Kill Switch

- You're unsure what's happening

**Remember: When in doubt, stop trading!**

### Post-Incident Review

1. Review all logs
2. Identify root cause
3. Test fixes in testnet
4. Implement safeguards
5. Resume only when confident

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

```python
# Example monitoring script
from utils import calculate_performance_metrics, load_trades_from_csv

trades = load_trades_from_csv("data/trades.csv")
metrics = calculate_performance_metrics(trades, initial_capital=100)

print(f"Total P&L: ${metrics['total_pnl']:.2f}")
print(f"Win Rate: {metrics['win_rate']:.1f}%")
print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {metrics.get('sharpe_ratio', 0):.2f}")
```

### Performance Thresholds

**Stop Trading If:**
- Daily loss > 5%
- Win rate < 40% over 20+ trades
