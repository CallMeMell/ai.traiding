            This PR appears to have **no changed files**. This means:
            
            - 🤖 **GitHub Copilot review will be skipped** (nothing to review)
            - 👥 **Human reviewers** won't be able to provide meaningful feedback
            - ✅ The PR may need to be updated with actual code changes
            
            ### 📋 Possible reasons:
            
            1. **Branch is up-to-date with base**: Your branch might already contain all commits from the base branch
            2. **Changes were reverted**: File changes might have been undone
            3. **Wrong base branch**: You might be comparing against the wrong branch
            
            ### 🔧 How to fix:
            
            1. Make sure you have committed changes to your branch
            2. Verify your branch has commits that aren't in the base branch:
               \`\`\`bash
               git log origin/${{ github.event.pull_request.base.ref }}..HEAD
               \`\`\`
            3. If needed, add your changes and push:
               \`\`\`bash
               git add .
               git commit -m "Your commit message"
               git push
               \`\`\`
            
            ---
            
            💡 **Tip**: Once you push changes, this PR will automatically update and Copilot will be able to review it.
