# Trading Bot Dashboard Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for PWA support:

- icon-96.png (96x96 pixels)
- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)  
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons are used for:
- Browser favorites/bookmarks
- Mobile home screen shortcuts
- Progressive Web App installation

Recommended design:
- Simple, recognizable logo (e.g., chart line icon)
- High contrast colors
- Works on both light and dark backgrounds
- PNG format with transparency

You can generate these using any image editor or online tool like:
- Figma
- Canva
- Favicon.io
- RealFaviconGenerator.net

Temporary fallback: The app will work without icons but won't have proper PWA appearance.
