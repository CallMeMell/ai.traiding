# Windows PermissionError Fix - Logging Tests

## Problem Statement

When running logging tests on Windows, the following error occurred:

```
PermissionError: [WinError 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process
```

### Root Cause

The issue was caused by Python's logging `FileHandler` objects not being properly closed after tests completed. On Windows, open file handles prevent file deletion or modification, causing the `shutil.rmtree()` cleanup in test fixtures to fail.

The problem occurred in:
- `tests/test_logger.py` - Multiple logging tests
- Any other tests that used `configure_logging()`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Global Auto-use Fixture (Primary Solution)

Added a global `cleanup_logging()` fixture in `tests/conftest.py` that automatically runs after every test:

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def cleanup_logging():
    """
    Auto-use fixture to clean up logging handlers after each test.
    
    This prevents PermissionError on Windows when trying to delete
    log files that are still open by FileHandler objects.
    """
    yield
    
    # Close and remove all logging handlers after each test
    loggers = [logging.getLogger()] + [
        logging.getLogger(name) for name in logging.root.manager.loggerDict
    ]
    
    for logger in loggers:
        for handler in logger.handlers[:]:  # Use slice to avoid modification during iteration
            try:
                handler.close()
            except Exception:
                pass  # Ignore errors during cleanup
            try:
                logger.removeHandler(handler)
            except Exception:
                pass  # Ignore errors during cleanup
    
    # Clear root logger handler list
    logging.getLogger().handlers.clear()
```

**Key Features:**
- `autouse=True` - Runs automatically after every test without explicit declaration
- Finds all loggers (root + named loggers)
- Closes all handlers safely with exception handling
- Removes handlers from loggers
- Clears the root logger handler list

### 2. Test-Specific Cleanup (Secondary Solution)

Added explicit cleanup methods to test classes in `tests/test_logger.py`:

- `TestConfigureLogging._cleanup_logging_handlers()`
- `TestLoggingIntegration._cleanup_logging_handlers()`

These methods are called in the `temp_log_dir` fixtures before `shutil.rmtree()`:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def temp_log_dir(self):
    """Create temporary log directory."""
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    yield temp_dir
    # Close all handlers before cleanup to avoid PermissionError on Windows
    self._cleanup_logging_handlers()
    shutil.rmtree(temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Windows Compatibility
- No more PermissionError on Windows
- Files are properly released before deletion

### ✅ Clean Test Isolation
- Each test starts with a clean logging state
- No handler leakage between tests

### ✅ Robust Error Handling
- Exceptions during cleanup are caught and ignored
- Tests won't fail due to cleanup issues

### ✅ Cross-Platform
- Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- No platform-specific code needed

## Test Results

All 141 tests pass successfully:

```
======================== 141 passed, 13 warnings in 72.62s ========================
```

Multiple sequential test runs confirm no PermissionError:
- Run 1: 13 tests passed ✓
- Run 2: 13 tests passed ✓
- Run 3: 13 tests passed ✓
- Run 4: 13 tests passed ✓
- Run 5: 13 tests passed ✓

## Files Modified

1. **`tests/conftest.py`**
   - Added `import logging`
   - Added `cleanup_logging()` autouse fixture

2. **`tests/test_logger.py`**
   - Added `_cleanup_logging_handlers()` method to `TestConfigureLogging`
   - Added `_cleanup_logging_handlers()` method to `TestLoggingIntegration`
   - Updated `temp_log_dir` fixtures to call cleanup before `shutil.rmtree()`

3. **`ISSUES.md`**
   - Documented the fix with ✅ BEHOBEN status
   - Added implementation details and test results

## Best Practices for Future Tests

When writing new tests that use logging:

1. **Use the global fixture** - It automatically handles cleanup
2. **Don't create persistent handlers** - Use temporary directories
3. **Test in isolation** - Each test should configure its own logging
4. **Use `enable_console=False`** - Prevents console output during tests

## Example Test Pattern

```python
def test_logging_feature(self, temp_log_dir):
    """Test a logging feature."""
    log_dir = os.path.join(temp_log_dir, 'test_logs')
    
    # Configure logging with temporary directory
    configure_logging(log_dir=log_dir, enable_console=False)
    
    # Test your logging functionality
    logger = get_logger('test')
    logger.info('Test message')
    
    # Verify results
    assert os.path.exists(os.path.join(log_dir, 'system.log'))
    
    # Cleanup happens automatically via the fixture
```
