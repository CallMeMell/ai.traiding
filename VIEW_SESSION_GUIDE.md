# ðŸ“Š View Session Feature Guide

## Overview

The **View Session** (Progress Monitor) feature provides a comprehensive interface for viewing, analyzing, and managing trading sessions. It allows users to review past trading activity, analyze performance metrics, export session data, and **monitor all active tasks in real-time** with full transparency.

### ðŸ†• Enhanced Active Task Monitoring

The View Session page now includes a dedicated **Active Tasks** section that provides:

- **Real-time tracking** of all ongoing operations (backtests, simulations, optimizations)
- **Elapsed time display** showing how long each task has been running
- **Estimated completion time (ETA)** based on current progress rate
- **Task summary statistics** showing counts of running, completed, and failed tasks
- **Visual progress bars** with percentage completion
- **Auto-refresh every 5 seconds** to keep information current
- **Detailed status information** for each task including type, details, and timestamps

## âœ¨ Universal Accessibility (NEW)

The View Session feature is now universally accessible from anywhere in the application:

- **Global Header Button**: A prominent "View Sessions" button is always visible in the header, regardless of which view or modal is currently open
- **Quick Access in Modals**: Every modal (Strategies, Trade History, Settings, Broker Connection) includes a "View Sessions" quick access button in its header
- **Seamless Navigation**: Switch to View Sessions from any view without having to close modals or navigate back to the dashboard

This ensures that you can always access your trading session history with a single click, no matter where you are in the application.

## Session Log Format

Session logs are stored in the `logs/` directory with the naming convention:
```
simulated_trading_session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```

### Log Structure

1. **Header Section**: Session start/end times, capital information
2. **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive trading metrics
3. **Execution History**: Detailed order-by-order breakdown

Example:
```
================================================================================
SIMULATED LIVE TRADING SESSION LOG
================================================================================
Session Start: 2024-01-01 12:00:00
Session End: 2024-01-01 14:30:00
Initial Capital: $10,000.00
Final Equity: $10,234.50
Total P&L: $234.50

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE METRICS
================================================================================
total_orders: 15

win_rate: 0.57
...

================================================================================
EXECUTION HISTORY
================================================================================
Order ID: SIM_1_1704110400000

## Performance Optimization

The View Session feature includes several optimizations:

1. **Lazy Loading**: Session details are loaded only when requested
2. **Efficient Parsing**: Log files are parsed on-demand
3. **Client-Side Filtering**: Search and filter operations happen in the browser
4. **Caching**: Session list is cached to reduce server load

## Styling and Theming

The View Session feature fully supports the dashboard's theme system:

- **Dark Mode**: Automatically adapts to dark theme
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and hover states
- **Color Coding**: Visual indicators for profit/loss

## Future Enhancements

Planned features for future releases:

- [ ] Real-time session monitoring for active sessions
- [ ] Session comparison tool (side-by-side comparison)
- [ ] Advanced filtering (date range, strategy type)
- [ ] Session analytics dashboard (aggregate statistics)
- [ ] Auto-archiving of old sessions
- [ ] Session notes and annotations
- [ ] Export to JSON format
- [ ] Print-friendly reports

## Troubleshooting

### No Sessions Displayed

**Problem**: The session list is empty

**Solutions**:
- Check if the `logs/` directory exists
- Verify that session log files follow the naming convention
- Run a simulated trading session to generate logs
- Check browser console for API errors

### Session Details Not Loading

**Problem**: Clicking "View Details" shows an error

**Solutions**:
- Verify the session log file exists and is readable
- Check the log file format is correct
- Look for parsing errors in the server logs

### Export Not Working

**Problem**: Export button doesn't download a file

**Solutions**:
- Check browser's download settings
- Ensure pop-ups are not blocked
- Verify the session exists and is accessible

## Integration with Simulated Trading

The View Session feature integrates seamlessly with the Simulated Live Trading environment:

```python
from simulated_live_trading import SimulatedLiveTradingEnvironment

# Create environment
env = SimulatedLiveTradingEnvironment(initial_capital=10000.0)

# Execute trades
env.place_market_order('BTCUSDT', 0.1, 'BUY')

# Save session log (automatically viewable in dashboard)
env.save_session_log()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Session Reviews**: Review sessions regularly to identify patterns
2. **Compare Strategies**: Use filtering to compare different strategy performances
3. **Export for Analysis**: Export data for deeper analysis in tools like Python or R
4. **Clean Old Sessions**: Periodically archive or delete old session logs
5. **Document Insights**: Keep notes about successful sessions for future reference

## Support and Feedback

For questions, issues, or feature requests:
- Check the main documentation
- Review existing session logs for examples
- Test with demo sessions before live trading
