# Issue: Synchronization of Pull Requests

## Description
Ensure that Pull Requests are always synchronized with the latest `main` branch to run new tests and coverage improvements successfully (e.g., via rebase or merge).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Pull Requests are merged only if they are up to date with `main`. 
- CI/CD pipeline checks for synchronization before merging.
