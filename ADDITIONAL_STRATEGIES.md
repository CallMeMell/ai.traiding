5. When sell order fills, place corresponding buy order below it
6. Continuously rebalance grid
```

### 20. Three White Soldiers / Three Black Crows

**Category:** Popular/Conservative  
**Risk Level:** ⚠️⚠️ (2/5)

**Description:**
Candlestick pattern indicating strong reversal. Three consecutive bullish (white soldiers) or bearish (black crows) candles with higher/lower closes.

**Core Logic:**
```
1. Identify downtrend/uptrend
2. Three White Soldiers: 3 consecutive bullish candles
   - Each closes higher than previous
   - Opens within previous body
   - Little to no wicks
   → Bullish reversal signal

3. Three Black Crows: 3 consecutive bearish candles
   - Each closes lower than previous
   - Opens within previous body
   - Little to no wicks
   → Bearish reversal signal
```

**Parameters:**
- `min_body_size`: Minimum candle body (1%)
- `max_wick_ratio`: Maximum wick/body ratio (0.3)
- `trend_confirmation`: Prior trend bars (10+)
- `volume_increase`: Volume confirmation (optional)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Clear visual pattern
- ✅ Strong reversal signal
- ✅ Easy to identify
- ✅ High probability when valid

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Rare pattern
- ❌ Can be false reversal (continuation)
- ❌ Requires prior trend
- ❌ Subjective recognition

**Best For:**
- Reversal trading
- Daily and 4H timeframes
- All markets

**Risk Management:**
- Wait for pattern completion (3rd candle close)
- Stop beyond pattern high/low
- Take partial profits quickly
- Confirm with support/resistance
