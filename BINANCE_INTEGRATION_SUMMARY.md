## 🔑 API Key Setup

### Testnet (Recommended for Testing)
1. Go to https://testnet.binance.vision/
2. Sign up with GitHub or email
3. Generate API keys (HMAC_SHA256)
4. Add to `keys.env`:
   ```env
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_testnet_key
   BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_testnet_secret
   ```

### Production (Live Trading - Use with Caution!)
1. Go to https://www.binance.com/
2. Complete KYC verification
3. Enable 2FA
4. Create API key with:
   - ✅ Enable Reading
   - ✅ Enable Spot & Margin Trading
   - ❌ **NEVER** enable Withdrawals
5. Add IP restrictions (highly recommended)
6. Add to `keys.env`:
   ```env
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_production_key
   BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_production_secret
   ```

## 🎯 Trading Strategies

All 5 strategies work with Binance:

1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
   - Mean reversion strategy
   - Buy when oversold (RSI < 30)
   - Sell when overbought (RSI > 70)

2. **EMA Crossover**
   - Trend following strategy
   - Buy when fast EMA crosses above slow EMA
   - Sell when fast EMA crosses below slow EMA

3. **MA Crossover**
   - Long-term trend strategy
   - Buy when short MA crosses above long MA
   - Sell when short MA crosses below long MA

4. **Bollinger Bands**
   - Volatility-based strategy
   - Buy near lower band
   - Sell near upper band

5. **LSOB (Long-Short On Breakout)**
   - Advanced volatility breakout
   - Uses Bollinger Bands + ATR + Volume
   - Dynamic position sizing

---

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### Built-in Features
- Position sizing limits
- Stop-loss orders (configurable)
- Take-profit targets (configurable)
- Daily loss limits
- ATR-based stops (LSOB strategy)

### Configuration
Edit `config.py`:
```python
# Risk Management
risk_per_trade = 0.02          # 2% risk per trade
stop_loss_percent = 10.0       # 10% stop loss
take_profit_percent = 20.0     # 20% take profit
max_daily_loss = 0.05          # 5% max daily loss
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### Critical Rules
1. ✅ **Never commit API keys** to git (keys.env is in .gitignore)
2. ✅ **Always test with testnet first**
3. ✅ **Never enable withdrawal permissions**
4. ✅ **Use IP restrictions** on production keys
5. ✅ **Enable 2FA** on your Binance account
6. ✅ **Monitor regularly** when running live

### Emergency Procedures
If you suspect API key compromise:
1. Immediately disable keys on Binance
2. Check account for unauthorized activity
3. Generate new keys
4. Review security settings
5. Enable additional security measures

## 🔄 Migration Path

### From Alpaca to Binance
The bot automatically prioritizes Binance but falls back to Alpaca if:
1. Binance API keys not found
2. Binance connection fails
3. User explicitly configures Alpaca

**No action needed** - the bot handles this automatically!

### Keeping Both APIs
You can keep both API configurations:
```env
# Binance (Primary)
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_binance_secret

# Alpaca (Legacy)
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret
```
